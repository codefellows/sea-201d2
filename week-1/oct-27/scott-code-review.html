    <h1>My Script - October 26, 2015</h1>
    <h2>Here's what the script on this page is doing...</h2>
    <p>Within the script tags I first have a basic "hello" alert, welcoming the user to the page and inviting them to play a guessing game!</p>
    <p>Next, I created variables with names pertaining to the questions they belong with. These variables prompt the user to answer 3 yes or no questions. After the user inputs either "Yes" or "No", an if/else statement is used to let the user know whether they have given the correct answer. I used the function .toLowerCase to make it so that the answer the user gives is not case sensitive by having the computer convert it to all lower case.</p>
    <p>At the end of the guessing game, I created a score variable, adding 1 point for every correct answer. The variable adds up the user's answers and let them know how many they got correct out of the 3 total questions using an alert!</p>
    <h2>A little about me...</h2>
    <p>My name is Miranda and I grew up in Seattle. I attended a small liberal arts college right outside of Los Angeles, CA, named Whittier College. I got a degree in Biology. After that I moved to West Hollywood and worked a desk job that I hated. I decided to move home to Seattle and pursue a career in coding! I'm excited to learn as much as I can over the next 4 weeks!</p>
